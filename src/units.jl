# Shared default-unit conventions for the JuliaForests org: every package that
# accepts plain numbers alongside `Unitful` quantities (diameters, heights,
# volumes, areas) promotes them against these same constants, so unitless and
# unitful workflows agree across packages, not just within one.

    withunit(x, u::Units)

Promotes a plain number (or vector of numbers) to a quantity in unit `u`, and
leaves an already-unitful quantity (or `nothing`) untouched. Lets a function's
keyword/positional arguments accept `Real` and `Unitful.Quantity` values
interchangeably and normalize to one or the other uniformly.
